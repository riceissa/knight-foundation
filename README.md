# Knight Foundation grants

This is for https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations

Specific issue: https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/issues/45

Use:

- `scrape.py` if you want to get new data from the Knight Foundation
  website. This will overwrite `data.csv` with the new data.
- `proc.py` if you want to use the existing data (stored in
  `data.csv`) to generate the SQL insertion file.
