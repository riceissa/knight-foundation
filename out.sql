The AP is looking to publicize the results, refine its methods and ultimately share new tools with other newsrooms.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)

Long Distance Voter wants to increase voter turnout by making it possible to sign up for an absentee ballot using smartphones. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, more than 25 percent of all ballots were cast by mail in 2014. Three states, Oregon, Washington and Colorado, have transitioned to a standard vote-by-mail system, with all three experiencing higher turnout and lower election administration costs. Voters in other states currently need to print and mail their forms in order to submit absentee ballots, which is difficult for many in an increasingly digital age. Long Distance Voter will use DocuSign’s electronic signature technology to enable citizens to complete, sign and mail their absentee ballots directly from their smartphones.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)

To bridge that gap, two New York public library systems and a citywide libraries and archives membership organization will create a mobile kit, with scanners and cameras, that libraries will take to city branches, so that residents are able to record their historical items. Each item will not only be housed in local digital archives but in the Digital Public Library of America and other large-scale initiatives such as Internet Archive, providing worldwide access to local treasures. While these events provide educational and community-building opportunities, they also democratize the process of history-making — allowing people to contribute to and help define their local history.

Boston, like many cities, has published a collection of “open data” that includes everything from building permits to a list of urban farms. The data tells a story about government and city life. Public interest in the data is clear -- with more than 14,000 views so far of neighborhood pothole data alone. But as with many forms of knowledge, making something available isn’t the same as making it useful. Through this project the city of Boston will work with local libraries to create a digital data catalog that will make it easier for residents, researchers and public employees to navigate.

Are they connected to political parties, public officials or organized crime?

Using this framework, the Solutions Journalism Network will collaborate with partner newsrooms and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation to scan data sets for “positive deviance” in the health sector— examples of promising health results that could lead to important stories. For example, journalists in a city with large black/white disparities in preterm birth rates could identify cities that have reduced this gap, and report on how the gains were achieved.

In New Mexico, locally owned community newspapers thrive in their small-town environments as the dominant source for news and information. Nevertheless, many do not have easy access to news from other communities of similar size and circumstance, even though they face many of the same issues related to water access, ranching, economic development and more. Through the Community News Exchange, each participating newspaper will grant access to their content to an editor, who will then prepare news briefs and stand-alone stories to be shared with all the participating newspapers. All outlets will also benefit from original coverage at the 2014 New Mexico Legislature.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)

The returns are filed as paper, and staff at the Wake County Board of Elections scan them in and put the images online.

Paired together, both programs will give artists the tailored, personal help they need to create a life that is both ambitious and achievable. Artists U is a grassroots, artist-run platform for changing the working conditions of artists. Having started in Philadelphia and expanded to Baltimore and South Carolina, Artists U wants to change the conversations artists have in their heads, with each other, and with the world.

Applicants for funding include legacy news organizations who are challenging their old reputations as lone wolves, not team players; start-up, entrepreneurial projects that are driven by the passion and creativity of one person or a team; public media seeking to move their journalism into action; and universities seeking to feed knowledge into all of these efforts through research and continuing education.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)

In collaboration with The Guardian Project, the international human rights organization WITNESS seeks to solve this problem by launching the InformaCam app. The mobile app allows users to incorporate key metadata in their video (who, what, where, corroborating identifiers), watermark it as coming from a particular camera, and share it in an encrypted format with someone the user trusts. News outlets, human rights organizations and everyday people could use the app in a variety of ways - for a breaking news story using first-hand video from a citizen journalist, sharing evidence of war crimes from a conflict zone, or to verify the images of a fender bender that someone could take to small claims court. Alongside this, WITNESS is advocating for incorporation of a “citizen witness” functionality based on InformaCam into other platforms and apps.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)

Yet the same digital age is creating many new individual opportunities for the most eager and entrepreneurial of these underrepresented journalists – if they have the right training.

Since its launch in San Francisco a year ago, about 30 articles have been proposed, funded and written, the highest profile one for The New York Times.

Drupal is an open source software package that allows anyone to start a news and information site. The software developers who improve it on a volunteer basis number more than 300,000. Millions download and use the software. Many of those users do not have extensive backgrounds in Web technology. Having clear, concise, up-to-date documentation is essential for the technically inexperienced who want to get a Web site implemented. Lack of good, accessible documentation leaves an extremely useful tool out of reach for many people. This grant will make the Drupal software easier to use by allowing more than two million current users to take full advantage of its capabilities, and by enabling more people with little or no technical knowledge to begin using it.

Filters would then use this data - the “story behind the story” - to help find high-quality articles. A reader searching the phrase “Pakistan riots” for example, might find 9,000 articles.

The national study, the largest of its kind, surveyed 112,000 students, nearly 8,000 teachers and more than 500 principals. It found that only half the nation’s high school students agree that the nation’s press should be able to publish without government interference. The survey reinforced support for Knight’s High School Journalism Initiative, which works with major journalism groups to help revitalize high school journalism and help students better understand the role of the First Amendment. With this grant, Ball State will train, coordinate and campaign to improve First Amendment education, use of news in classrooms and student media. It will hold workshops reaching 1,000 educators.
