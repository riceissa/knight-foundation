While there is a long history of philanthropic funding for libraries in the United States, most public libraries rely on government funding for financial support. Local funding accounts for nearly 85 percent of public library funding, and state funding has decreased nearly 43 percent over the past decade. Foundation Center will develop a data visualization and mapping tool, along with training, for libraries to find and track funding opportunities and increase understanding of funding for both libraries and library supporters. The tool will allow users to search and see funding sources at the national, state and local levels and answer key questions about regional funding trends. Data visualizations such as maps, network connections and partnership pathways will highlight key networks of funders and recipients as well as individual grants. Foundation Center will also deliver grant-seeking training, in-person and online, to build libraries’ capacity to effectively tap new funding sources. Foundation Center will partner with the Digital Public Library of America to leverage its extensive combined national networks to disseminate this tool and training.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Visualizing Philanthropic Funding for Libraries')

Each item will not only be housed in local digital archives but in the Digital Public Library of America and other large-scale initiatives such as Internet Archive, providing worldwide access to local treasures.

Launched in beta in San Mateo County, Calif., this Code for America project connects the public with community resources through one centralized database. Need help paying for food, finding affordable healthcare or connecting with a social worker? Ohana, an open source project functioning much like a 2-1-1 service, can help people locate the services they need, display them on a map and make them easily printable. This database unites information on health, human and social services that are often kept in separate silos, making localized results difficult to find. Exposing the data through a web API, the tool allows users to quickly access targeted community information through applications like search engines, smart phones, or SMS.

Since the 1990s, prescription drug abuse has significantly increased in the United States. However, a lack of actionable information about prescription drug abuse risk, despite the increase of state monitoring programs, makes it difficult to combat the problem. SafeUseNow; aims to reduce abuse by making prescribing safer and more effective. The tool uses data to identify combinations of prescribers, patients, and pharmacies who may be contributing to the problem. This information helps healthcare stakeholders educate prescribers to more effectively and safely treat patients. It also allows them to monitor prescribing patterns for changes in trends and behavior. A successful pilot with one health plan provider achieved a significant reduction in key risk factors.

While the language may sound new, the principles of New Urban Mechanics - collaborating with constituents, focusing on the basics of government, and pushing for bolder ideas - are not. In fact, Boston’s Mayor, Thomas M. Menino, who is known as the Urban Mechanic, has been preaching this mantra for years.

This project will create a system to do just that. The plan: to design a way for content creators to add information on their sources to their reports, as a form of “source tagging.” For instance, a reporter could note that an article was based on personal observations, interviews with eyewitnesses or specific, original documents. Filters would then use this data - the “story behind the story” - to help find high-quality articles. A reader searching the phrase “Pakistan riots” for example, might find 9,000 articles. But filtering by “eyewitness accounts” would yield a more selective list.

In the 1990s, the association convinced leaders throughout the hemisphere to sign the Declaration of Chapultepec in support of free expression. At the time journalists were killed in Latin America and South America with an impunity rate of 100 percent, meaning that every murdered escaped without arrest, prosecution, conviction or imprisonment. IAPA began to develop an Impunity campaign, a successful combination of rapid response teams that investigate murders, coverage of the crimes and letter to local authorities, a hemisphere-wide advertising campaign and visits to heads of state. After a year of study, IAPA has determined that the next best phase for this campaign would be to expand its campaign for arrests to be made in the murders of journalists by making impunity “everybody’s problem.” The project would be expanded by organizing forums and meetings with judges and lawmakers in countries where there is the greatest likelihood that policy and legal changes […]',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'IAPA: Impunity Project')

CPJ studied impunity worldwide and chose very different countries, Russia and the Philippines, to test techniques pioneered by IAPA.

It found that only half the nation’s high school students agree that the nation’s press should be able to publish without government interference. The survey reinforced support for Knight’s High School Journalism Initiative, which works with major journalism groups to help revitalize high school journalism and help students better understand the role of the First Amendment. With this grant, Ball State will train, coordinate and campaign to improve First Amendment education, use of news in classrooms and student media. It will hold workshops reaching 1,000 educators.
