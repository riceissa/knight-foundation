	In Camden, New Jersey, as in many U.S. cities, 30 percent of healthcare costs come from just 1 percent of patients. Many of these patients arrive in emergency rooms seeking care for easily treatable or preventable conditions; they are often faced with a fragmented, uncoordinated and expensive health care system. The Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers is addressing this problem by sharing data between the city’s hospitals and providers to better target resources and proactively tackle patient health issues. The Camden Health Explorer is the next step in this effort. The Explorer, built in partnership with BlueLabs, an analytics, data and technology firm, will aggregate anonymized individual health and medical claims data, then display and map the results by demography and geography. Camden Coalition staff will work with local stakeholders, including hospital administrators, providers, and policymakers, to ensure the data is used to make Camden’s healthcare system more efficient and ultimately make patients healthier.

Founded by writers of the New York Times “Fixes” column, the Network works with newsrooms looking to include regular coverage of how communities, individuals and institutions are addressing challenges – and what society can learn from such efforts. Using this framework, the Solutions Journalism Network will collaborate with partner newsrooms and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation to scan data sets for “positive deviance” in the health sector— examples of promising health results that could lead to important stories. For example, journalists in a city with large black/white disparities in preterm birth rates could identify cities that have reduced this gap, and report on how the gains were achieved.

To address this problem, the Public Laboratory wants to provide more low-cost chemical analysis tools, including simple devices that can be plugged into smartphones and laptops, so residents can measure the effects themselves instead of relying on costly labs. With its community of over 3,500 active members, Public Lab raised $110,000 in 2012 through Kickstarter to use DIY spectrometry tools to identify petroleum in sediments in coastal Louisiana and monitor emissions from oil refineries, among other projects.

The tool uses data to identify combinations of prescribers, patients, and pharmacies who may be contributing to the problem. This information helps healthcare stakeholders educate prescribers to more effectively and safely treat patients.

	Our database contains top research studies that we have selected and synthesized, as well as recommended results from a customized search across the wider Web, which we have designed to emphasize credible, citable sources. Search our library here on any topic. We try to serve as a helpful guide and interpreter — think of us a friend who does close reading and translation of statistics and jargon. While we can’t provide access to the full text of every study, we try to provide at least a point of entry and some key, useful points.

Unlike traditional servers that can take hours or days to set-up, GitMachines can be up and running in minutes and are pre-configured to meet government guidelines.

	The Record will release a new open-source program to help journalists turn PDF files into structured data. The new software will enable reporters to take an image containing data — say a scanned campaign finance return — and turn that into a spreadsheet.

	This may sound boring, but it’s a problem that we at the Record have been trying to overcome for more than two years. The story started with Wake County campaign finance returns. The returns are filed as paper, and staff at the Wake County Board of Elections scan them in and put the images online. The problem is, the only way to view the data is to look at it page by page, and the only way to analyze it is to go through by hand and enter the data into a spreadsheet one row at a time.

	We’re a small news organization; we don’t have the staff to do data entry for hundreds of pages of campaign finance information. We also don’t have the budget to hire some unfortunate college students to do it for us.

	Edward Duncan, my brother and a full-time programmer, and I have been thinking about how to tackle this problem since 2010. We had been kicking ideas back and forth until Edward stumbled across this solution last summer.

	The new program aims to pull the data from the documents and put it into a spreadsheet.

	It’s called DocHive, and here’s how it works: the program uses XML, a computer programming language used mainly for websites, to break a page up into smaller sections.

	For example, in the campaign finance documents, it will make separate sections for donor name, occupation, donation amount and all the other fields. Then, it will take each of those sections and turn it into a separate image file. The software takes that small image and uses optical character recognition technology, known by the acronym OCR, to read the couple words or numbers and insert it into a text file.","Raleigh Public Record, Inc."

	Launched in July 2013 by Kansas, City, Mo. based startup, Luminopolis, Neighbor.ly aims to apply the power of crowdsourcing to large community endeavors, rather than individual projects. Companies, foundations and individuals can use the platform to directly support civic projects such as neighborhood wifi, bike paths, even initiatives as ambitious as light rail – the type of projects that return a high quality of life and address wider social issues, but are often the first to be slashed during budget cuts. Funding for the projects can include development of a strategic plan or bringing the community together to get consensus around a particular topic.

What is New Urban Mechanics?

	New Urban Mechanics is an approach to civic innovation focused on delivering transformative City services to residents.

	While the language may sound new, the principles of New Urban Mechanics - collaborating with constituents, focusing on the basics of government, and pushing for bolder ideas - are not.

	In fact, Boston’s Mayor, Thomas M. Menino, who is known as the Urban Mechanic, has been preaching this mantra for years. Through the pairing of big ideas and the knowledge of constituents’ specific interests, Menino has become Boston’s longest serving mayor, and the city has become one of the most envied in the country. Likewise, in Philadelphia, Mayor Michael A. Nutter has built a strong reputation by improving education and safety and strengthening partnerships with neighborhood organizations as he leads the nation’s fifth largest city.

	To speed the rate of municipal innovation in their respective cities, Mayor Menino, in 2010, and Mayor Nutter, in 2012, created Mayor’s Offices of New Urban Mechanics. Part of the local government, this office serves as each City’s innovation incubator, building partnerships between City agencies and outside institutions and entrepreneurs to pilot projects in Boston that address resident and business needs.

The Mechanics focus on a broad range of areas from increasing civic participation, to improving City streets, to boosting educational outcomes. The specific projects are diverse as well – from better designed trash cans to high tech apps for smart phones.

	Across all these projects, the office strives to engage constituents and institutions in developing and piloting projects that will re-shape City government and improve the services we provide.",Emerson Engagement Lab

Usually, venues adapt to the needs of the musicians; here, musicians will adapt to the acoustics and layout of this unorthodox site in which sound carries in unexpected ways and whispers can be heard from 100 feet away. Applicants don’t have to be skilled in traditional music – someone who wants to explore the sounds of bottles and cans will be as eligible as a violinist. The eight residents will participate in studio tours where the public can hear works in progress, in addition to three concerts at which they will perform solo and ensemble pieces.

	The Obie and Barrymore Award-winning Pig Iron Theatre Company will work with one of Philadelphia’s highest-profile indie rock bands, Dr. Dog, to create a concert spectacle billed as a multimedia opera in the tradition of Pink Floyd’s “The Wall.” Combining the band’s music with Pig Iron’s adventurous performance style and live performers from Philadelphia’s contemporary dance and theater communities, this collaboration aims to revolutionize the experience of live rock music. The project will bring together two passionate but disparate groups of fans — both indie rock fans and indie theater lovers — to build a new audience for hybrid performance in Philadelphia and beyond.

	Since its inception in 1995, Pig Iron Theatre Company has grown from a small, fringe performance troupe into one of the best-known groups of its kind on the East Coast. Over that time, they have created 27 original works, garnering praise from audiences, peers, and critics. The New York Times hailed Pig Iron as “one of the few groups successfully taking theatre in new directions.” Rather than beginning their work from a writer-proposed script, they start with an idea, a character, or a situation, and allow the ensemble to forge the piece through focused improvisation and discussion.",Pig Iron Theatre Company

Fisher Fund, founded by Mrs. Fisher to support families in need.

All funds raised through Benevolent are sent as a grant to the nonprofit which then fulfills their client’s needs.  Individuals’ profiles are regularly updated to show donors the immediate impact of their contributions.

In seeking applicants, we’ve made clear that projects focused on collaboration and partnership will get preference when it comes to funding.

	Applicants for funding include legacy news organizations who are challenging their old reputations as lone wolves, not team players; start-up, entrepreneurial projects that are driven by the passion and creativity of one person or a team; public media seeking to move their journalism into action; and universities seeking to feed knowledge into all of these efforts through research and continuing education.",Community Foundation of New Jersey

News outlets, human rights organizations and everyday people could use the app in a variety of ways - for a breaking news story using first-hand video from a citizen journalist, sharing evidence of war crimes from a conflict zone, or to verify the images of a fender bender that someone could take to small claims court.

Umbel does this by correlating audience social information with web analytics and other data to create real insight into who the audience is, what they like and who might be interested in reaching them.

	Austin, Texas, May 15, 2012 – Umbel, which aims to set the standard for digital audience measurement, today announced that Knight Foundation participated in the company’s $3.7 million Series A round of venture financing through its Knight Foundation Enterprise Fund, a new, early-stage venture fund dedicated to advancing media innovation. The amount of the strategic investment was not disclosed.

	Umbel marries traditional research and big data analysis of social sources to give publishers real-time intelligence about the audiences that engage with them. With this information in hand, Umbel empowers publishers to convey their audience’s true value and brand preferences more effectively to advertisers and sponsors. The recently-raised funds will be used to support new hires and aggressively execute on the product roadmap.

	“By enabling news providers to become more data driven, Umbel makes original, online news content much more valuable,” said Michael Maness, vice president for journalism and media innovation at Knight Foundation. “At a time when newspapers are losing $7 to $10 in print revenue for every $1 gained in digital revenue, being able to significantly boost the digital side will dramatically strengthen the ability of media organizations to inform and engage their communities.”

	“Knight Foundation was a clear choice of investor for us. Our missions align and we have immense respect for all the foundation has accomplished so far. Their endorsement is great validation of Umbel’s technology, vision and purpose and through their large network of media, educational and nonprofit partners, we will deliver a new standard for measuring digital audiences,” said Paul Krasinski, Umbel’s CEO. “We're tackling a huge problem holding back almost all media companies, brands and non-profits today. The data to solve the problem absolutely exists. We will bring forth the technology that transforms that data into insights and puts publishers back in control over the the value of their hard-earned audiences.”",Umbel

	Current community planning processes regularly take up to a year and often engage only a handful of residents. Community PlanlT has the ability to change that by speeding up the process to a few days and perhaps most dramatically by increasing citizen participation in local decision making. The platform will expedite community learning and participation around the local planning process through approximately 30 days of online engagement that culminates in a face-to-face meeting with planning officials and other participants

	Knight's initial 2010 investment in HUB 2.0, the predecessor to Community PlanlT, resulted in an open-source online social media/game platform for place-based planning. The platform has been implemented in two communities in the Boston area and its effectiveness as an engagement tool has been positively evaluated.

	The theme of the TED 2012 conference is “Full Spectrum.” Full Spectrum is a term that TED has adapted to mean the use of multiple formats and approaches to create the most powerful possible impact on an audience. Full Spectrum is an invitation for the TED community to think about perspective, about collaboration and innovation. It’s an opportunity to showcase connectivity, data collection and the idea eco-system. It acknowledges globalization through local discussion on how language helps us with our desire to understand. Full Spectrum is considering the sense of possibility that comes when we think about the different perspectives on a single story.","TED Conferences, LLC"

Personal stories of youth around the globe—the challenges they face, their ideas for social change, and their visions for economic improvement will engage peers as well as global leaders. Participants will use uniform central questions to shape the subject of their stories. An example question may be: “How is your life today and how do you envision a better tomorrow?” The topic chosen will provide a springboard to share accounts of their personal lives and their ideas to drive transformation in their communities. PTP connects youth around the world to share ideas, gain a better understanding, build friendships, and share their hopes for the future. It educates, heals, transforms, enlightens, inspires, and creates an opportunity for an improved future not only for the participants, but for all of us who listen to their stories.

	The Knight Commission on the Information Needs of Communities in a Democracy was a blue ribbon panel of seventeen media, policy and community leaders that met in 2008 and 2009. Its purpose was to assess the information needs of communities, and recommend measures to help Americans better meet those needs. Its Report, Informing Communities: Sustaining Democracy in the Digital Age, was the first major commission on media since the Hutchins Commission in the 1940’s and the Kerner and Carnegie Commissions of the 1960’s.

	In the digital age, technological, economic and behavioral changes are dramatically altering how Americans communicate. Information is more fragmented. Communications systems no longer run along the same lines as local governance. The gap in access to digital tools and skills is wide and troubling. This new era poses major challenges to the flow of news and information people depend on to manage their complex lives.

	The Commission’s aims are to maximize the availability and flow of credible local information; to enhance access and capacity to use the new tools of knowledge and exchange; and to encourage people to engage with information and each other within their geographic communities. Among its 15 recommendations the Commission argues for universal broadband, open networks, transparent government, a media and digitally literate populace, vibrant local journalism, public media reform, and local public engagement.

	The Commission seeks to start a national discussion leading to real action. Please let us know what measures you believe will advance the cause of Information Healthy Communities.",Aspen Institute

	Every year, on average, several dozen journalists are killed across the globe because of their work. In 9 of every 10 cases, those responsible literally get away with murder. When societies refuse to silently accept the slayings of people like judges and journalists, when they stand up for the free flow of information needed to investigate and bring perpetrators to justice, they advance the cause of freedom. CPJ wants to use its global leadership to expand the impunity work worldwide, starting with the nations where journalists are most likely to be assassinated, specifically Russia and the Philippines.. During the grant, CPJ will continue to call international attention to the murders of journalists in Russia and the Philippines, seeking arrest and prosecution of those responsible. CPJ will lead other free press organizations to unite in the fight against impunity and will expand this pilot to a third country. It is hoped that as a result, the arrest rate will begin to increase, the impunity rate to decline. By the end of this grant, CPJ is expected to demonstrate the actual country-by-country impact needed to further expand this campaign worldwide.

	For decades, mass media scholars have argued that general-interest newsrooms work best when they reflect the communities they seek to serve. Yet members of key demographic groups – African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, women, and gay and lesbian journalists – are still not in newsrooms in the way they are in the general population. As the digital age causes the “creative destruction” of traditional media, newsroom diversity is shrinking, not growing. Yet the same digital age is creating many new individual opportunities for the most eager and entrepreneurial of these underrepresented journalists – if they have the right training.

	This grant creates a seven-way partnership between the nation’s most popular provider of journalism training, the Poynter Institute, and six professional journalism groups to offer training scholarships to worthy individuals. Poynter Institute is a school dedicated to teaching and inspiring journalists and media leaders. It promotes excellence and integrity in the practice of craft and in the practical leadership of successful businesses. It stands for a journalism that informs citizens and enlightens public discourse.

	The six participating journalism organizations are: National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ); National Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ); Native American Journalist Association (NAJA); Asian American Journalist Association (AAJA); Journalism and Women Symposium (JAWS); and National Lesbian and Gay Journalism Association (NLGJA). This grant will give $50,000 to Poynter to partner with six professional journalism organizations to subsidize individual costs associated with Poynter’s on-site and online training. The winners of these awards will be known as Knight-Poynter fellows. Poynter will use its range of training venues, including NewsU, Poynter Online, webinars, chats, on-site seminars and regional workshops to broadly reach journalists. In addition, each of the six journalism organizations will receive $20,000 for a one-time injection of operational support. This grant will increase the training opportunities for at least 100 journalists from under-represented groups by freeing limited organizational funds and by partially or fully subsidizing digital training programs. It is expected that this grant will promote a group of journalists in digital training to become more employable and more promotable.

	Spot.us is a 2008 Knight News Challenge winner. It uses micropayments collected from the public to fund local investigative and enterprise reporting. Since its launch in San Francisco a year ago, about 30 articles have been proposed, funded and written, the highest profile one for The New York Times. Rather than backing a news organization, the public is asked to consider funding individual stories. By seeing what stories the public is willing to pay for, and creating a mechanism to do so, Spot.us is testing the viability of an alternative funding stream for local news during an era in which daily newspapers are shedding local reporters.

	This project will extend Spot.us to Los Angeles through a partnership with the University of Southern California School of Journalism. The platform will be redeveloped to be more easily extended to additional cities with new features.

	The Texas Tribune is a new nonpartisan, nonprofit media startup whose mission is to promote civic engagement and discourse on government, politics, public policy and other matters of statewide interest. The core product of the Texas Tribune will be its destination web site, www.texastribune.org. The site will blend text reporting with the newest presentation and visualization tools; audio and video; original source documents; highly curated news aggregation from other sources; and proprietary, searchable databases. Texas Tribune will produce events and specialized publications, and plans to syndicate content to other online, print and broadcast news outlets.

	In addition, Texas Tribune will document best practices – both on the editorial and business side -- and share them with the larger news community, including other Knight grantees, through the new Investigative Reporting Network. Texas Tribune will help fill the new void in the amount of quality statewide news coverage in Texas, the nation’s second most populous state. They expect to reach its growth targets and become a sustainable model for other statewide news sites to follow.

	The Texas project will collaborate with other Knight projects in California, New York, and Washington, D.C., forming a core of nonprofit reporting projects in the nation’s capital and its three largest states as part of Knight Foundation’s Investigative Reporting Initiative.

	Source documents are the foundation of investigative journalism. Yet, once used, the documents are often either locked away or thrown away. They are lost to further inquiry. In a few cases, source documents are placed on the Web. But those are in a variety of formats, difficult to search.

	This grant will create a new way to find, search, annotate and share documents among news organizations or individuals. It will be tested in New York in a partnership with the Gotham Gazette. The grantee will create an open standard for describing and sharing information about source documents. The project will take source documents beyond the limited search capabilities of the PDF format and make them an intrinsic part of the searchable Web. The software will be released as public, open-source code for use by others.

	Sunlight Foundation was founded in January 2006 to harness the power of the Internet and new information technologies to enable citizens to learn more about what their elected representatives are doing. Sunlight aims to use the tools of open government to help reduce corruption, improve the conduct of public officials and increase the public’s trust in its democratic institutions.

	The digital revolution has created the potential for a quantum leap in government openness – but only if we can make its instant information easy to find and use. Sunlight Foundation proposes to create a series of new, easy-to-use web tools to allow journalists and citizens to know not just about earmarks but many other actions of our Congressional representatives.

	During the next two years, the grantee will develop, market and distribute a series of easy-to-use open-source software programs to provide journalists and citizens “integrated information” on Congress. These tools will provide more information about members of Congress more easily to more web users than ever before. This nonpartisan project can be expected during the midterm election to increase debate of fact-based issues the data reveals: earmarks, campaign contributions, federal contracts, voting records.

	Crowd-sourcing is the practice of asking a community to contribute its knowledge to a report on a given topic. Wikis are web pages that anyone can contribute to or edit. These techniques are combined in this grant to engage citizens to more actively participate in local politics. This project will enlist New Yorkers to scrutinize records and share what they know about local legislators, their actions, and their funders.

Councilpedia is a test of whether or not New Yorkers will collectively report on their city council using the methods that millions of people worldwide have used to create and check their own encyclopedia, Wikipedia. With this grant, Gotham Gazette will expand its City Council coverage through a wiki devoted to local legislators and those who donate to the legislators’ campaigns. The project will provide coverage and context about campaign contributions and voting records.

	We expect this “crowd sourcing” and “citizen journalism” to encourage richer coverage that usual of local political campaigns as well as greater public participation in the election.

	At a time when the traditional business and distribution models are no longer viable on their own, the biggest challenge for ethnic media is bridging the digital divide so they can continue to meet the information needs of their communities. The opportunity here is to help these outlets secure their own long-term survival by creating a model to develop and sustain a collective online presence. This grant will expand the Ethnic Media Digital Divide project to San Jose and New Orleans, creating two online hubs that will allow local ethnic publications to collaborate together, share technical resources and increase marketing potential individually and as a group.

	It is expected that these hubs will develop self-sustaining business plans by the end of the grant, and will serve as demo sites to encourage other small ethnic media organizations to bridge the digital divide. Ultimately, this grant will promote the visibility and viability of ethnic media, giving voice to otherwise voiceless communities in the emerging digital public forum.",Pacific News Service

	This grant is part of the Knight Drupal Initiative, a contest that taps into and uses the social network and aggregated knowledge of a technology community for the benefit of better grant-making. The digital revolution means the local public square is moving online. More and more, the places that connect individuals together and help them discover their common needs and challenges are local online news and information sites. But in a networked world, a single online community can be like a single island in the ocean. Communities need a network through which they can connect with other communities that might have similar needs and challenges so that they can learn from one another.

It is expected that the new free publishing system will allow communities to receive, create and share information both within the community and with other communities.

Drupal is an open source software package that allows anyone to start a news and information site. The software developers who improve it on a volunteer basis number more than 300,000. Millions download and use the software. Many of those users do not have extensive backgrounds in Web technology. Having clear, concise, up-to-date documentation is essential for the technically inexperienced who want to get a Web site implemented. Lack of good, accessible documentation leaves an extremely useful tool out of reach for many people.

Facebook is one of the world's fastest-growing web sites, a social networking site with scores of millions of users. This experiment allows Knight Foundation to help create a free and easy-to-use online news area that is integrated into Facebook. It would allow any of the millions of Drupal-software users to create their own easy-to-use news site that can be shared via Facebook. The new software also would allow Facebook profiles to be imported into the Drupal news sites, making it easy for the news site users to create their own communities.

	With the copious amounts of information – and misinformation – on the Internet, the public needs more help finding fair, accurate and contextual news. This project will create a system to do just that. The plan: to design a way for content creators to add information on their sources to their reports, as a form of “source tagging.” For instance, a reporter could note that an article was based on personal observations, interviews with eyewitnesses or specific, original documents. Filters would then use this data - the “story behind the story” - to help find high-quality articles. A reader searching the phrase “Pakistan riots” for example, might find 9,000 articles. But filtering by “eyewitness accounts” would yield a more selective list. Berners-Lee, Moore and the Web Science Research Initiative are working with the BBC and Reuters on how to best integrate the tagging into journalists’ normal workflow.",Tides Center

	Printcasting will allow individuals to easily create ad-supported, customized publications with a mix of local news and information. The software will help aggregate feeds from news organizations, bloggers or newsletters, for example, so that would-be publishers can pick and choose among them to create a niche publication. The Printcasting model then will guide users through placing articles, photos and ads onto a template that either could be delivered by e-mail or printed at home and distributed. For example, a publication for reef-diving photographers could include ads for nearby dive shops or underwater cameras. The idea is to pair localized ads and content to create targeted publications.",Tides Center

	The Sociedad Interamericana de Prensa, also known as the Inter American Press Association Press Institute, has defended freedom of the press in the Americas for more than half a century. In the 1990s, the association convinced leaders throughout the hemisphere to sign the Declaration of Chapultepec in support of free expression. At the time journalists were killed in Latin America and South America with an impunity rate of 100 percent, meaning that every murdered escaped without arrest, prosecution, conviction or imprisonment. IAPA began to develop an Impunity campaign, a successful combination of rapid response teams that investigate murders, coverage of the crimes and letter to local authorities, a hemisphere-wide advertising campaign and visits to heads of state. After a year of study, IAPA has determined that the next best phase for this campaign would be to expand its campaign for arrests to be made in the murders of journalists by making impunity “everybody’s problem.” The project would be expanded by organizing forums and meetings with judges and lawmakers in countries where there is the greatest likelihood that policy and legal changes need to occur. In addition, IAPA will directly train 1,000 journalists in safety practices, conduct investigations and widely distribute educational materials on that topic in all media. It is expected that fewer journalists should die in situations that might have been avoided.

It has been impressed with the highly structured project by the Inter American Press Association to fight “impunity’’ for those who would kill journalists. The decade-long IAPA Impunity campaign has produced more than 75 convictions in cases of the murder of journalists, and changed national laws to remove statues of limitations and provide federal prosecution for those who would kill human rights workers, journalists, judges and other people working for civil society.

	CPJ studied impunity worldwide and chose very different countries, Russia and the Philippines, to test techniques pioneered by IAPA. During the next two years, CPJ will raise the public profile of impunity in Russia and the Philippines by campaigning for arrests to be made in the murders of journalists and investigating and publishing information about the deaths of journalists and missing journalists.

	Gotham Gazette will produce at least three “news games” each year, for two years. The games will focus on life and problems in New York City. They will put the players into the shoes of decision-makers. Using real information about civic life, each game will show players how key decisions can change the course of a community. The choices individuals make will be tallied and available on the web site. Those choices, as well as players’ ideas and comments, will be presented to relevant public officials for further discussion. Gotham Gazette also will partner with community organizations to hold public forums with citizens, civic leaders, policy experts and city officials to discuss the results. Gotham Gazette will seek assistance from Knight News Challenge gaming experts in New York City, especially the Parsons School of Design, which offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in game design. Tentative games are:



The Garbage Game, where player have to juggle cost, environmental impact and fairness to find a way to handle the city’s garbage problem. Players will become their household garbage and follow the route it takes.



Emergencies, where players will have to reconcile the society’s need for security with its need for civil liberty.



The Health Game, which uses the Bloomberg administration’s bans on smoking and transfats to examine what else could be done to help people be healthier.



Land Use, where the player juggles demands for parks, retail space, housing and other community needs.



	Gotham Gazette will do a blog explaining how it created these open-source games, for a Knight Foundation web site, so others can use the software to create their own serious games. It also will submit a final report that details what worked and what didn’t in this project. The source code for the creation of news games produced by this grant will be free and available under General Public License by June 2009.

	On Jan. 31, 2005, Knight released “The Future of the First Amendment,” a two-year, $1 million research project by the University of Connecticut.  The national study, the largest of its kind, surveyed 112,000 students, nearly 8,000 teachers and more than 500 principals.  It found that only half the nation’s high school students agree that the nation’s press should be able to publish without government interference. The survey reinforced support for Knight’s High School Journalism Initiative, which works with major journalism groups to help revitalize high school journalism and help students better understand the role of the First Amendment. With this grant, Ball State will train, coordinate and campaign to improve First Amendment education, use of news in classrooms and student media. It will hold workshops reaching 1,000 educators.

	Since 1997, in conversations with thousands of journalists, the Committee of Concerned Journalists has crusaded on behalf of quality journalism as defined in the signature book, “The Elements of Journalism.” In 2001, a Knight pilot grant created the “Traveling Curriculum,’’ a training program designed to take the committee’s standard-setting work directly into newsrooms. The training, designed with teaching experts at Stanford University, has reached some 5,500 journalists from 100 news organizations.  The web site, www.journalism.org, averages 32,000 unique visitors a month. Training sessions are followed by six-month reviews to push for and review tangible results. A formal assessment program by researchers at Stanford has established concrete changes at every newsroom to date. With this grant, the committee will move to the University of Missouri. There, it will train at least 4,000 additional journalists during the next three years as it develops a “fee for service” model for the training.",University of Missouri
